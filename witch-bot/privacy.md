# Automatic Storing of Data
## Cached Data Storage
- Cached data is stored to reduce redundant requests to Discords API, and will be erased on restart of the bot, or when data becomes outdated.
- Cached data will not be accessible outside of the bots internal uses, such as remembering the ID of a server or channel, or remembering a users roles or ID.

## Long Term Data Storage (Database)
- Some user supplied information may be stored in a database through specific commands, such as game characters for profile fetching, or preferred timezones for command results.
- The bot, and the bots owner, may not share any stored information outside of the discord(s) the user is in.
- The bot, and the bots owner, may not sell any stored information.
- The bot may only store information provided willingly through a slash command or prefix command.

# Removal of Data
## Cached Data Removal
- In the event the bot is removed from a server, cached data will not be refreshed and will become 'stale' and inaccessible.
- Upon restart of the bot, or manual request upon contact, cached data will reset.

## Long Term Data Removal (Database)
- In the event the bot no longer shares a server with a user, saved data will become inaccessible.
- Manual data removal of cached or database entries can be requested by contacting the bot owner.
